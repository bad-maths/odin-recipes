                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>A timeless classic featuring noodles you'll overcook and a sauce you'll inevitably "make your own" by dumping in whatever's dying in your fridge. Rich, savory, and just forgiving enough that you can pretend you meant to do it that way. Serve with a side of crushed dreams and parmesan from a can, because who are we kidding?</p>

                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>400g spaghetti (or whatever half-open box you find in the pantry)</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil (extra virgin, because you're fancy now)</li>
                        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced (or just scream "garlic" at it and hope for the best)</li>
                        <li>1 can (400g) crushed tomatoes (bonus points if it expired last month)</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste (the sad hardened bit from the tube is fine)</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano (or "mixed Italian seasoning" if you gave up halfway)</li>
                        <li>½ teaspoon chili flakes (optional, but strongly encouraged if you like chaos)</li>
                        <li>Salt, to taste (meaning: way more than you think)</li>
                        <li>Freshly cracked black pepper (pretend you're on a cooking show while doing this)</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon sugar (because your sauce has trust issues)</li>
                        <li>½ cup grated parmesan cheese (real or powdered — no judgment... okay, maybe a little)</li>
                        <li>Fresh basil leaves for garnish (or a single sad sprig you found wilting in the fridge)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="steps">
                    <h3>Steps</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Boil a large pot of water.
                            (If you forget the salt, congratulations — you've made sadness soup.)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once the water is aggressively bubbling like it's mad at you, throw in the spaghetti.
                            Cook until "al dente" — which is Italian for "you're probably doing it wrong but close enough."
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat.
                            Add minced garlic and stir just until it smells so good you start questioning your life choices.
                            Do not burn it unless you enjoy the taste of failure.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Dump in the crushed tomatoes and the tomato paste.
                            Stir like you're trying to hide your mistakes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Season with oregano, chili flakes, salt, pepper, and the sugar.
                            (Yes, sugar. Because life is already bitter enough.)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Let the sauce simmer on low heat for about 10–15 minutes.
                            Use this time to stare into the middle distance and reconsider your priorities.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Drain the spaghetti when it's "done" — meaning soft but still pretending to be firm.
                            (Reserve a little pasta water like every food blog says, even if you have no idea why.)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Toss the pasta into the sauce. Add a splash of that reserved water if you're feeling like a culinary wizard.
                            Mix until the noodles look like they belong there and not like they just wandered in drunk.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Top with parmesan cheese. Garnish with a heroic, barely alive basil leaf for aesthetic purposes.
                            Take a photo. It won't look good, but it's tradition.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Serve immediately.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Pretend you spent hours on it.
                            Accept your Michelin star in your heart.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                <p>
                    <h3>In the 1800s, ketchup was sold as medicine.</h3>
                    It was marketed as a cure for indigestion — basically, doctors were out here prescribing tomato sauce shots like it was Tylenol.

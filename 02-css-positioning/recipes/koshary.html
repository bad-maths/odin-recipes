                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>Koshary — Egypt's national dish that's basically what happens when someone opens their pantry, finds five different types of carbs, and thinks "You know what? Let's just throw them all together and call it cuisine." Rice, pasta, lentils, chickpeas, and fried onions all hanging out in one bowl like some sort of starchy support group.</p>
                    <p>This "comfort food" is topped with tomato sauce and garlic vinegar because apparently, we needed more flavors competing for attention. It's the culinary equivalent of "organized chaos" — somehow it works, even though logic says it shouldn't. Perfect for when you can't decide what to eat, so you just eat everything.</p>

                            <li>1 cup basmati rice (or whatever rice you have lying around)</li>
                            <li>2 cups water (groundbreaking, I know)</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon salt (because bland rice is a crime)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <li><b>For the Pasta:</b></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1 cup elbow macaroni (the pasta that gave up on being fancy)</li>
                            <li>Salt for boiling water (we've been through this)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>1 cup brown lentils (the protein that's trying its best)</li>
                            <li>3 cups water (more water, shocking)</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon salt (sensing a pattern yet?)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <li><b>For the Extras:</b></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1 can chickpeas, drained (the lazy person's protein)</li>
                            <li>3 large onions, sliced (prepare for tears, again)</li>
                            <li>Vegetable oil for frying (enough to deep-fry your regrets)</li>

                            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced (garlic makes everything better, apparently)</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon cumin (the spice that screams "I'm exotic")</li>
                            <li>Salt and pepper to taste (translation: dump and pray)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced (more garlic, because why not?)</li>
                            <li>½ cup white vinegar (the bite that wakes you up)</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon salt (salt in everything, apparently)</li>

                    They were selectively bred to be orange in honor of the Dutch royal family. So basically, vegetables have political affiliations now.

# Web Layout Evolution: Recipe Website

A comprehensive demonstration of how web layout techniques have evolved from the 1990s to modern CSS, using the same recipe website implemented with different approaches throughout web development history.

## Project Overview

This repository showcases the evolution of web layout design through multiple implementations of the same recipe website. Each folder represents a significant era in web development, allowing developers to understand how layout techniques, browser capabilities, and best practices have progressed over time.

## Layout Implementations

## Educational Goals

Each implementation demonstrates:
- **Historical Context**: Why certain techniques were used
- **Technical Approach**: How layouts were achieved
- **Limitations**: Problems that led to evolution
- **Browser Support**: What was possible at the time
- **Best Practices**: What was considered good development

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse Chronologically**: Start with `01-table-layout` and progress through each era
2. **Compare Implementations**: See how the same design is achieved differently
3. **Understand Evolution**: Learn why techniques changed over time
4. **Practice**: Try modifying each implementation to understand the constraints

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bad-maths/odin-recipes.git

# Navigate to any implementation
cd 01-table-layout

# Open in browser
open index.html
```

Each folder contains its own README with detailed explanations of the techniques used and historical context.

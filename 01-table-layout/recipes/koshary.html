                        They were selectively bred to be orange in honor of the Dutch royal family. So basically, vegetables have political affiliations now.

                                <p>Koshary — Egypt's national dish that's basically what happens when someone opens their pantry, finds five different types of carbs, and thinks "You know what? Let's just throw them all together and call it cuisine." Rice, pasta, lentils, chickpeas, and fried onions all hanging out in one bowl like some sort of starchy support group.</p>
                                <p>This "comfort food" is topped with tomato sauce and garlic vinegar because apparently, we needed more flavors competing for attention. It's the culinary equivalent of "organized chaos" — somehow it works, even though logic says it shouldn't. Perfect for when you can't decide what to eat, so you just eat everything.</p>
